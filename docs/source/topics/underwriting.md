# Insurance Undewriting

Insurance underwriting is the process insurers use to evaluate the risk of insuring a person, asset, or business. It determines whether the insurance company will issue a policy, under what terms, and at what cost

## Functions of insurance underwriting

1. Risk Assessment:

    - Evaluate the risk level of the insured (e.g., individual, property, or business).
    - Identify potential liabilities and likelihood of a claim.
    - Classify risks into categories (low, medium, high).

2. Pricing Premiums:

    - Use risk assessment to calculate the premium.
    - Higher risk often leads to higher premiums or specific exclusions.

3. Policy Terms and Conditions:

    - Define terms like coverage limits, deductibles, and exclusions.
    - Tailor the policy to fit the unique needs of the insured while protecting the insurer.

4. Decision Making:

    - Decide whether to accept or reject the application for insurance.
    - Offer alternative terms to balance risk and reward.

5. Compliance:

    - Ensure policies comply with legal, regulatory, and organizational standards.

6. Portfolio Management:

    - Maintain a balanced mix of policies to ensure overall profitability.
